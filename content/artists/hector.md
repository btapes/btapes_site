Hector Barrera is one of the reasons the project of bTapes took off. He appear just when I was going to start the home studio and gave me my first job that wasn't fully personal. Since there, we started a journey of discovery and learning about the artistic and technical details of making music.

He was very into rap music as well as acustic reggae performances. First we engaged on the rap side of him as I wanted to learn more about producing beats and we had a common ground on the hip hop lofi genre.
