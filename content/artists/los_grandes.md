This is a project that I made with some friends to make a cover of C.Tangana. It was made one morning to have some fun and the result is very unpolished. 

The idea is to keep up on making more songs with spanish flamenco vibes, so hopefully we will get better and learn something from it.

Canto magno flamenco-andaluz y heterodoxo - *Lionel Ponce*

Gran antología del antiguo arte de la guitarra clásica - *Juan Iranzo*

Maestría de los ritmos archivo del tesoro nacional - *Pablo Pérez*
